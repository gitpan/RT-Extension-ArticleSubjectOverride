NAME
    RT-Extension-ArticleSubjectOverride - Override Subject when selecting an
    Article

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ArticleSubjectOverride));

        or add "RT::Extension::ArticleSubjectOverride" to your existing
        @Plugins line.

        By default, this will only be available on ticket Update with the
        normal Articles UI. If you'd like to use it on Create, you'll need
        to enable the config option for Articles on Create.

    On RT 4.0.2, you need to apply the included patch to add two necessary
    callbacks
            $ patch -d /opt/rt4 -p1 < patches/0001-Add-two-new-callbacks.patch
            patching file share/html/Admin/Articles/Classes/Modify.html

        This patch is unnecessary for RT 4.0.3 and higher.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

USAGE
    This extension will add a new dropdown to class basics page. It allows
    you to choose one of your article custom fields and have it override the
    subject. When used in a reply, this affects the subject of the
    transaction, not the ticket. When used on ticket creation, it changes
    the subject of the ticket. If you do not want this subject custom field
    to appear in the body of your Article, use the standard class checkboxes
    to avoid including it.
